Q.1) Python program that demonstrates the hill climbing algorithm to find the maximum of a 
mathematical function.(For example f(x) = -x^2 + 4x)
import numpy as np
def objective_function(x):
 """
 The objective function to maximize.
 """
 return -x**2 + 4*x
def hill_climbing(initial_x, step_size, num_steps):
 """
 Hill climbing algorithm to find the maximum of a function.
 """
 current_x = initial_x
 for step in range(num_steps):
 current_value = objective_function(current_x)
 next_x = current_x + step_size
 next_value = objective_function(next_x)
 if next_value > current_value:
 current_x = next_x
 return current_x, objective_function(current_x)
# Set initial parameters
initial_x = 0.0
step_size = 0.1
num_steps = 100
# Run the hill climbing algorithm
result_x, result_value = hill_climbing(initial_x, step_size, num_steps)
# Print the results
print(f"Maximum found at x = {result_x}")
print(f"Maximum value is {result_value}")
Output:
Maximum found at x = 2.0000000000000004
Maximum value is 4.0
